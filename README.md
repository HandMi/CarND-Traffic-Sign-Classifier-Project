Overview

---

This is Project 3 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. In this project convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to classify images from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

The results of the project are summarized in the [write-up](writeup.md)
